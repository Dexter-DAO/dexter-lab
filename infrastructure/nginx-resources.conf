# Nginx configuration for x402 resources
# This routes res-*.dexter.cash (resource containers) to the Traefik reverse proxy
#
# Resource URLs: https://res-{id}.dexter.cash
# Covered by Cloudflare Universal SSL via *.dexter.cash wildcard
#
# Symlinked from: /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/resources.dexter.cash.conf
#
# NOTE: Cloudflare SSL mode is "Full" - it terminates client SSL, then connects
# to origin via HTTPS. We use the dexter.cash cert (Cloudflare doesn't validate
# the hostname in Full mode, only in Full Strict).
