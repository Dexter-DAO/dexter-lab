    "dexDescription": "BloxAPI powers Roblox-style games with live data. When hooked up to BloxAPI, actions in games react to real buys, real hype, and real community momentum. \n\nWhy a token? Roblox has a strict policy and doesn't allow crypto to be used for ingame payment, and no crypto wallets, gambling, etc to protect its users (which is good!). However, external integrations can be used to power lots of things, including rewards, cosmetics, or gameplay features.\n\nBloxAPI provides this link with $BLOXX!\n\nDevs unlock the power to integrate their game with any token, leading to a new wave of on-chain games for the next generation! \n\nPLAYER UTILITY\n\u2022 Holder cosmetics (auras, badges, trails)\n\u2022 Access to Chaos Events (dragons, storms, world shifts)\n\u2022 Special in-game disaster creation or boss summoning\n\u2022 Weekly rewards for top disaster creators (who killed the most players with a disaster or boss?)\n\u2022 Higher token tiers unlock:\n** VIP badges in all games\n** Special holder-only maps and missions\n** Control the gameplay for everyone\n** Higher player rewards\n\nDEVELOPER UTILITY\n\u2022 Integrate your Roblox game with BloxAPI\n\u2022 Integrate your Roblox game with any token\n\u2022 Games get access to on-chain data, AI assisted gameplay, and cross-game persistence. \n\u2022 Higher token tiers unlock:\n** Higher API limits\n** Game analytics\n** Multi-game integration slots\n** Early access to new SDKs\n\nTOKENOMICS\nThe $BLOXX token will be used in part to power buybacks and incentives for building, with a separate marketing budget to be setup from trading and creator fees.\n\nROADMAP\nSee the website for an updated roadmap",
